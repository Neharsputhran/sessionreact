## Introduction to React

React.js is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It was developed by Facebook and is now one of the most popular libraries for building single-page applications (SPAs). React allows developers to create reusable UI components and efficiently update and render the right components when data changes.

### Key Features of React:
- **Component-Based**: Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to create complex UIs.
- **Virtual DOM**: React uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update and render only the necessary parts of the UI.
- **Unidirectional Data Flow**: Data flows in one direction, which makes the app easier to debug and understand.

React is mainly used for:
- Building dynamic web apps
- Creating reusable UI components
- Handling large applications with changing data

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have installed the following:
- **Node.js**: [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm**: Node.js package manager (comes with Node.js)
  
### Installation and Running

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Neharsputhran/sessionreact.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project folder**:
   ```bash
   cd sessionreact
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   Use the following command to install all the required npm packages:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run the application**:
   Start the development server with:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   Your React app should now be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Features
- **To-Do List**: A simple to-do list component demonstrating React state management and event handling.
- **FontAwesome Icons**: Integrated FontAwesome icons for UI enhancements.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is responsive and works across different device sizes.
